The goal of the project is to link mothers with suitable employees who can effectively take care of children as well as doing house chores. 
This will be achieved through developing a mobile phone application.
There is a significany skills gap and its is a challenge assessing suitable househelps. The application will display profiles of available nannies.
This will make linking the nanny and employers easier.
